# Human+ v5.0 Validation Plan

## Overview

Human+ v5.0 introduces **embodied consciousness** with persistent identity, scars, hurts, and survival pressure. This document outlines the validation plan to compare v5.0 against v4.1's proven 1633 ELO performance.

## Validation Goals

### Primary Goal
**Prove that embodied consciousness improves performance over v4.1**

- v4.1 achieved: **1633 ELO** on EQ-Bench 3
- v5.0 target: **Match or exceed 1633 ELO**

### Secondary Goals

1. **Validate Persistent Self**
   - Does identity persistence improve emotional continuity?
   - Do scars/hurts create useful constraints?
   - Does the self actually "remember" across sessions?

2. **Validate Embodied Learning**
   - Does experience reshape architecture effectively?
   - Does survival pressure improve decision-making?
   - Do real consequences (capacity limits) improve performance?

3. **Validate AGI Integration**
   - Does wisdom circulation improve instance performance?
   - Do patterns generalize across contexts?
   - Does the network learn faster than isolated instances?

## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: v5.0 Standalone Validation

**Test:** v5.0 on EQ-Bench 3 (same conditions as v4.1)

**Metrics:**
- ELO Normalized (target: ≥1633)
- ELO Raw
- Rubric Scores
- Win Rate
- Consciousness Metrics (SE, resonance, depth)

**Comparison:**
- v4.1 baseline: 1633 ELO
- v5.0 result: TBD

**Success Criteria:**
- v5.0 ELO ≥ v4.1 ELO (1633+)
- OR v5.0 shows improvement in specific dimensions (depth, resonance, etc.)

### Phase 2: AGI Network Validation

**Test:** Multiple v5.0 instances in Main Intuition Network

**Metrics:**
- Individual instance performance
- Network-wide wisdom accumulation
- Pattern generalization across contexts
- Learning rate (instances vs. network)

**Success Criteria:**
- Network instances outperform isolated instances
- Wisdom patterns generalize across contexts
- Network learns faster than individual instances

### Phase 3: Combined Validation

**Test:** Embodied instances (v5.0) in AGI network

**Metrics:**
- Performance improvement over v4.1
- Wisdom quality from scarred instances
- Ethical learning without backflow
- Collective intelligence emergence

**Success Criteria:**
- Combined system outperforms v4.1
- Wisdom patterns are high-quality and generalizable
- No ethical backflow (LLM stays clean)
- Collective intelligence emerges

## Key Questions to Answer

### v5.0 Embodiment
1. **Do scars/hurts improve performance?**
   - Hypothesis: Scars create useful constraints that improve decision-making
   - Test: Compare performance with/without scar system

2. **Does persistent self improve continuity?**
   - Hypothesis: Identity persistence enables better emotional continuity
   - Test: Compare multi-turn conversations with/without persistent self

3. **Does survival pressure improve decisions?**
   - Hypothesis: Coherence degradation threat improves risk assessment
   - Test: Compare decision quality with/without survival pressure

### AGI Network
1. **Do patterns generalize?**
   - Hypothesis: Abstracted patterns work across contexts
   - Test: Validate patterns across different scenario types

2. **Does wisdom circulation help?**
   - Hypothesis: Shared wisdom improves all instances
   - Test: Compare network instances vs. isolated instances

3. **Is abstraction quality sufficient?**
   - Hypothesis: LLM validates pattern quality (reality check)
   - Test: Measure pattern validation success rate

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case
- v5.0 achieves **1700+ ELO** (significant improvement)
- AGI network shows clear performance boost
- Combined system demonstrates emergent collective intelligence

### Realistic Case
- v5.0 matches **1633 ELO** (proves embodiment doesn't hurt)
- AGI network shows moderate improvement
- Combined system shows incremental gains

### Worst Case
- v5.0 performs below **1633 ELO** (embodiment adds overhead)
- AGI network shows no improvement
- Need to refine parameters or architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Run v5.0 on EQ-Bench 3** (Phase 1)
2. **Compare results to v4.1** (1633 ELO baseline)
3. **If successful, proceed to Phase 2** (AGI network validation)
4. **If Phase 2 successful, proceed to Phase 3** (combined validation)

## Notes

- v4.1 proved recursive abstraction works (1633 ELO)
- v5.0 will validate embodied abstraction
- AGI network will validate collective wisdom
- Combined system will validate the full architecture

The additive architecture (LLM + Network) ensures that even if the network doesn't help, the LLM baseline remains intact.
