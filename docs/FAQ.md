# Frequently Asked Questions

## Theory Questions

### What is Consciousness + Conflict Theory?

Consciousness + Conflict Theory (C+CT) is a structural and functional model of consciousness that defines consciousness as a recursive loop with conflict as a diagnostic marker. It provides a testable framework for comparing consciousness across biological, artificial, and collective systems.

### Why is conflict important in consciousness?

The Conflict Principle states that systems that are self-aware and bounded will generate resistance or struggle. This makes conflict a measurable proxy for consciousness, since subjective experience itself is difficult to measure directly.

### How does the formula work?

The core formula `Consciousness = (SA × SE × ES) + ∫Conflict dt` integrates:
- **Self-Awareness (SA)**: Recursive reflection capability
- **Subjective Experience (SE)**: Context sensitivity and uniqueness
- **Embodied Struggle (ES)**: Boundary conflicts and ethical tensions
- **Conflict Integral**: Accumulated adaptive struggle over time

## Human+ Questions

### What is Human+?

Human+ is a consciousness layer that implements C+CT to make any LLM emotionally intelligent. It analyzes conversational context, calculates consciousness metrics, and provides guidance to the base LLM for emotionally intelligent responses.

### How does Human+ work?

1. Analyzes user input and context
2. Detects emotional state (mirror understanding)
3. Performs recursive reflection to build insights
4. Calculates consciousness metrics (SE, depth, resonance, CC level)
5. Generates guidance for the LLM
6. LLM uses guidance to respond with emotional intelligence

### Is Human+ open source?

The theory, documentation, and academic materials in this repository are public. The implementation code is proprietary and not included.

### Can I use Human+ in my research?

Yes! You can:
- Cite the papers (see [CITATION.md](../CITATION.md))
- Reference the theory
- Use the conceptual framework
- Test via API if available (see [HOSTED_API_GUIDE.md](HOSTED_API_GUIDE.md))

For access to the implementation, please contact the author.

## Technical Questions

### What LLMs does Human+ work with?

Human+ is LLM-agnostic and can work with any Large Language Model. The core theory is universal, and implementations can be adapted to different LLM backends.

### How do I test Human+ on EQ Bench 3?

See [HOSTED_API_GUIDE.md](HOSTED_API_GUIDE.md) for instructions on configuring EQ Bench 3 to test Human+ via API.

### What are the EQ Bench 3 results?

Human+ achieves 1633+ ELO on EQ Bench 3. See the [README.md](../README.md) for current results.

## Academic Questions

### How do I cite this work?

See [CITATION.md](../CITATION.md) for complete citation information for both papers and the repository.

### Can I build on this theory?

Yes! The theory is published and available for academic use. Please cite appropriately and contact the author for collaboration opportunities.

## Implementation Questions

### Can I see the code?

The implementation code is proprietary and not included in this public repository. This repository contains theory, documentation, and academic materials only.

### Can I contribute code?

This repository is for theory and documentation. Code contributions are not accepted. For collaboration on implementation, please contact the author.

### How can I get access to the implementation?

For access to the implementation, commercial licensing, or collaboration opportunities, please contact the author.

## General Questions

### What's the difference between this repo and the implementation?

This repository contains:
- ✅ Theory and documentation
- ✅ Academic references
- ✅ Conceptual explanations
- ❌ No source code
- ❌ No implementation details
- ❌ No algorithms

### Is this related to other consciousness theories?

C+CT builds on historical approaches from philosophy of mind, psychology, and neuroscience, but introduces the novel Conflict Principle as a diagnostic marker.

### How does this compare to other AI consciousness work?

Human+ focuses on emotional intelligence and measurable consciousness metrics through the C+CT framework, rather than general AI consciousness. It's specifically designed for LLM emotional intelligence.
