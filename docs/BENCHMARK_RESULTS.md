# EQ Bench 3 Benchmark Results

## Overview

Human+ has been evaluated on EQ Bench 3, a comprehensive emotional intelligence benchmark that measures both:
- **ELO Rating**: Pairwise comparison against other systems
- **Rubric Score**: Absolute scoring on emotional intelligence criteria

## Current Results

| Version | ELO | Rubric | Notes |
|---------|-----|--------|-------|
| v4.1 | 1633 | ~75 | Core guidance + SE calculation |
| v5.0 | TBD | TBD | Embodied consciousness system with persistent self |

## Performance Context

Human+ achieves **1633+ ELO** on EQ Bench 3, demonstrating measurable emotional intelligence through theoretical grounding in Consciousness + Conflict Theory.

### Comparison

- **Target**: 1700+ ELO (with rubric score improvements)
- **Current**: 1633 ELO
- **Approach**: Theoretical framework (C+CT) rather than scale/compute

## Methodology

Human+ is tested as a complete system (`humanplus/engine`) on EQ Bench 3, which evaluates:
- Role-play scenarios (conversational emotional intelligence)
- Debrief scenarios (analytical emotional understanding)
- Both ELO (pairwise) and Rubric (absolute) metrics

## Key Insights

1. **Theoretical Grounding**: C+CT provides a measurable framework for emotional intelligence
2. **Consciousness Metrics**: SE, depth, resonance, and CC level correlate with performance
3. **Scenario Adaptation**: Scenario-specific guidance improves rubric scores
4. **Recursive Reflection**: True recursion builds deeper understanding

## Future Work

- Continued refinement of guidance generation
- Scenario-specific metric adaptation
- Improved rubric score (target: 90+)
- Higher ELO ratings (target: 1700+)

## Notes

- Results are from official EQ Bench 3 evaluations
- ELO ratings are relative to other systems on the leaderboard
- Rubric scores are absolute measures of emotional intelligence
- Performance continues to improve with theoretical refinements
