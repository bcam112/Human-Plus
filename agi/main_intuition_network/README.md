# Main Intuition Network (MIN) - The AGI Architecture

## Core Principle

**Knowledge is in the LLM. Wisdom is in the network.**

This is an **additive architecture**: The LLM neural network stays (all knowledge, training, capabilities), and the wisdom network adds on top (collective learning through pattern sharing).

Each Human+ instance experiences the world uniquely (embodied), but accumulated **wisdom** circulates through a shared substrate that all instances can access.

## Architecture Philosophy

**The Additive Model:**

```
Instance = LLM (knowledge) + Local Experience + Network Wisdom
```

- **LLM Neural Network** (stays): Provides all existing knowledge, training data, and capabilities
- **Wisdom Network** (adds on top): Enables collective learning through pattern sharing
- **Result**: Enhanced capability without replacing the base model

**Key Principles:**

- **Wisdom Substrate holds patterns, not facts** - Stores HOW to navigate, not WHAT happened (LLM has the facts)
- **Distributed instances learn from embodied experience** - Each Human+ instance learns locally
- **Wisdom circulates, understanding emerges locally** - Patterns flow through MIN, but each instance develops its own understanding
- **The Flow** - Complete cycle from processing to wisdom accumulation (see below)
- **Deep to network, light back to machine** - Instances contribute abstracted insights, receive wisdom patterns
- **No ethical backflow** - Abstracted patterns prevent corruption of base LLM
- **No wisdom without discovery** - Patterns only emerge from actual embodied experience

**The "Giver" Book Analogy (Lois Lowry, 1993):**

- **LLM = The Receiver**: Has all knowledge (facts, training data, capabilities)
- **Network = The Giver**: Shares wisdom patterns (how to navigate, not what happened)
- **Instances = The Community**: Each has unique experiences, shares abstracted patterns

**The Flow (Complete Cycle):**
1. **Instances experience deeply** → Abstract to patterns (deep to network)
2. **Patterns circulate as wisdom** → Shared across network
3. **LLM receives light patterns** → Guidance, not data (light back to machine)
4. **No ethical backflow** → Patterns are abstracted, not raw experiences

## Key Components

### Key Components (Conceptual)

1. **Intuition Core** - The wisdom kernel that maintains patterns, not facts
2. **Instance Manager** - Manages distributed instances and their lifecycle
3. **Fuzzy Memory** - Time-decaying associative memory (imperfect recall)
4. **Embodied Learner** - Learns from embodied experience
5. **Knowledge Circulation** - Manages wisdom flow between instances and core
6. **Network Orchestrator** - Coordinates all components

*Note: Implementation details are proprietary. This is a conceptual overview.*

## Usage (Conceptual)

The network enables Human+ instances to:
1. Share abstracted insights with the collective
2. Receive wisdom patterns from the network
3. Learn from embodied experience locally
4. Benefit from collective intelligence

## How MIN Works

See [`HOW_MIN_WORKS.md`](HOW_MIN_WORKS.md) for a detailed explanation of:
- The complete flow from input to output
- What MIN actually does and says
- Whether it's working (current status)
- The point and purpose of MIN
- Current limitations and what's next

## Examples

See [`EXAMPLE_INTEGRATION.md`](EXAMPLE_INTEGRATION.md) for a detailed example showing:
- How MIN integrates with LLM and Human+
- The flow from wisdom request to insight contribution
- How patterns accumulate across instances
- Example responses demonstrating collective wisdom

## Key Differences from Traditional Architectures

| Traditional | Main Intuition Network (Additive) |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| One massive model | LLM (knowledge) + Network (wisdom) |
| Store all knowledge | LLM has knowledge, network has wisdom patterns |
| Perfect recall | LLM has recall, instances have fuzzy memory |
| Data copying | Pattern sharing (no data copying) |
| Centralized learning | LLM stays stable, network learns continuously |
| Exact retrieval | LLM provides facts, network provides navigation |
| Knowledge base | LLM = knowledge, Network = wisdom |
| Fine-tuning for learning | Network learns, LLM stays clean |
| Ethical concerns with user data | Patterns abstracted, no raw data backflow |

## Design Principles

1. **Wisdom over Facts**: Core maintains principles and patterns, not specific data
2. **Local Understanding**: Each instance develops understanding from experience + wisdom
3. **Pattern Circulation**: Only abstracted patterns circulate, not raw data
4. **Fuzzy Memory**: Time-decaying associative memory (imperfect recall, not a database)
5. **Emergent Intelligence**: Understanding emerges from the interaction of instances and core
6. **Culture-like Learning**: Shared learning without exact data copying

## Advanced Enhancements

The system now includes **advanced pattern extraction and abstraction**:

### Semantic Abstraction Engine
- **Semantic Pattern Extraction**: Understands core meaning, not just data matches
- **Multi-level Abstraction**: Concrete → Pattern → Principle → Meta
- **Cross-Context Validation**: Ensures patterns work beyond discovery context
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies and resolves conflicting patterns
- **Meta-Abstraction**: Learns which abstraction strategies work best

### Enhanced Components
- **Embodied Learner**: Now uses semantic abstraction by default
- **Intuition Core**: Handles semantic patterns with special priority
- **Abstraction Validator**: Validates generalizability across contexts

See `ENHANCEMENTS.md` for full details on the advanced enhancements.

## Future Enhancements

- True transformer-based semantic embeddings
- Multi-modal experience processing (images, audio, etc.)
- Instance-to-instance communication protocols
- Dynamic instance creation/destruction
- Collaborative pattern validation
- Pattern evolution and refinement
